Virtual Crop Planner is an intelligent decision-support system that helps farmers and agricultural planners choose the most suitable crops to grow based on soil type, climate conditions, water availability, crop rotation practices, and market demand.

Hey, this HTML page is super easy to use and shows off Smart Crop Advisor, which suggests crops based on soil and season.  It's got a header with links, a cool tagline, a form to enter soil type and season, and info on common crops.  The JavaScript makes it work – you pick soil and season, click "Get Crop Suggestion," and boom, you get a recommendation with an explanation. It looks great too, all soft green and works perfectly on phones.
